<p><div class="border">"I've been WisdomRepublic Subscriber for a long time, including JEE Live Classes as well as IIT JEE Course.</div></p><p><div>It is much better than any course, in my opinion. JEE Live classes provide you the platform for class tests, unit tests, and chapter tests (including the best possible analysis). It's features are more than enough to lead you to a proper path for cracking JEE and any equivalent competitive examination. Not to forget, you'll have to give all the tests and be parallel to their approach.</div></p> <p><div>It was probably the first year for WisdomRepublic JEE Live Course, and it has gained the required momentum. So, seeing the positive side of it, I'll suggest you to go with the WisdomRepublic course.</div></p> <p><div>The teachers have all the potential to teach you the syllabus for JEE and they interact a lot during the classes. And I'll honestly don't say much about this as the teachers keep changing in between."</div></p>
